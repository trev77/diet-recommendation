# Meal Recommender Project

This repository contains the codebase for the Meal Recommender project.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory for all data-related items
  - `raw/`: Raw data, do not alter, do not upload large files to version control
  - `processed/`: Processed data, ready for training
- `models/`: Trained model files, do not upload large files to version control
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and interactive code execution
- `src/`: Source files for the project
  - `preprocessing/`: Scripts for data preprocessing
  - `training/`: Scripts for model training
  - `evaluation/`: Scripts for model evaluation
  - `utils/`: Utility scripts and helper functions

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. Execute `bash setup_repo.sh` to create the directory structure and initial setup files.

## Data Version Control (DVC)

We use DVC to track data and model versions. To start tracking a file or directory with DVC, follow the steps below:
1. `dvc add your_file_or_directory`
2. `git add your_file_or_directory.dvc .gitignore`
3. `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
4. `dvc push`

To set up remote storage for DVC, refer to the official [DVC documentation](https://dvc.org/doc).

## Weights & Biases (W&B)

This project uses Weights & Biases for experiment tracking. To use W&B:
1. Sign up on the [W&B website](https://wandb.ai/).
2. Install the W&B client by running `pip install wandb`.
3. Log in from the command line using `wandb login` and follow the instructions.
4. Integrate W&B in your scripts for training, evaluation, etc., as described in the official [W&B documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/).
